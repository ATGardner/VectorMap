The vector maps try to reduce the visual baldness of the fill patterns, which is a good change. Currently, this was done by increasing the spacing by 5-6 times.

However, this large spacing is hard to notice in small areas. On the other hand, it allows only a small level of transparency before the pattern becomes unnoticed.
